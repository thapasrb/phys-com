# Learning Python 3.7

Python is very popular programing language used in large number of disciplines. Learning Python is very helpful in teaching and research. Nepal Physical Society has managed online classes for its life members by requesting Dr. Dibakar Sigdel, data scientist, UCLA, USA to help as instructor. Thanks to NPS as well as DR. Dibakar Sigdel. Four  Teaching Assistants- all Mr. Devendra, Madhu,Yogesh and karan are ghelping to all aspirants. 

## Installation of Python

First step in learning Python is to install Anaconda Python 3.7 on laptop. Installation process depends upon the operating system on the laptop. It is done according to the instructions as well as link provided by NPS on first document after registration. Github account open is also instructed.

### My laptop

My laptop posseses Ubuntu 16.07 as operating system. Installation of anaconda python is done using terminal and follpowing the instructions of the provided link. I made separate directory py_thon and installed there.

#### Jupyter notebook

Jupyter notebook is first tep to learn. To launch the Jupyter notebook terminal is opened then going into directory py_thon 'anaconda-navigation' is typed and enter is pressed. Finally launch on Jupyter notebook is clicked. To create a file on desktop, desktop is selected and new is pressed on RHS. Python 3 is selected.

#### Home work

I.   Create Github repository.
II.  Create Jupyter notebook containing title, subtitle, paragraph, math equation  and picture. Upload it in    Github repository.
III. Put Github address in our assignment tracker google form.

## Math Equation

$ a^2+b^2+2ab=(a+b)^2$

#### Pythagoras Theorem

$$ p^2+b^2+h^2$$

#### Symbols

$ \alpha $ , $ \beta $ , $ \gamma $ , $ \delta $ , $ \theta $ , $ \phi $ , $ \psi $ ,$ \Delta $ , $ \nabla $

$ \vec{a} $

$ \frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d} $

#### quadratic equation

$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} $

#### Differential equation

$ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+\frac{dy}{dx}+3x=0$

#### Schrodinger equation

$\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+ \frac{2m}{\bar{h}^2}(E-V)\psi=0 $

$-\frac{\bar{h^2}}{2m}\nabla^2\psi(\textbf{r})+V(\textbf{r})\psi(\textbf{r})=E\psi(\textbf{r}) $

$i\bar{h}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi=\hat{H}\psi$

$\frac{\partial^2\psi}{dx^2}+\frac{\partial^2\psi}{dy^2}+\frac{\partial^2\psi}{dz^2}+\frac{8\pi^2m}{h^2}(E-V)\psi=0$

### integrations

$$ \int x^2 dx =y $$

$$ \int_{a}^{b} x^2 dx = y $$

$ \iint_{a}^{b} x^2 dx = y $

$$ \iiint_a x^2 dx = y $$

#### Gauss divergence theorem

$$ \iiint_v (\nabla.\textbf{F})dv=\oint\oint_S (\textbf{F}.\textbf{n})dS $$

#### mix equation

$$\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)$$

$$\iiint f(x,y,z) \,dx\,dy\,dz= y $$

$$ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n} = 1 $$
